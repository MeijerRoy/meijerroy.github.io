As trained econometrician, I am interested in modelling and forecasting time series. My research focuses on labour market forecasting.

Under the co-supervision of SBE’s Department of Quantitative Economics (QE), my research aims to refine the econometric methodology underlying ROA’s labour market forecasting models. The project focuses on improving the labour market forecasts by assessing the reliability and exploring the potential of using additional data and applying different estimation techniques.
